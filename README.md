## DS Plugins

A collection of python files that show how to use a certain api that is bound to a Google Colab file via Anvil. Calling the api with certain adjustments to the input via a function will essentially provide us with a function that we can create as a package, and import as a module.

* `test_plugin.py` calls a primitive version of an auto captioning model and returns some captions.

To test these functions, clone and run each file as required. They basically call an api which can be called with required changes as it is.
